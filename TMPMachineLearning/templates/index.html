                They say when you come across a penny on the ground showing heads up it's a lucky penny, and you should
                pick it up; however, if it's tails up, it's unlucky, and you should just leave it on the ground. We're
                here to turn that unlucky penny over to bring the luck to you and grow your wealth.

It is a subset of the Russell 3000速 Index and includes approximately 1,000 of the largest securities based on a combination of their market cap and current index membership. The Russell 1000速 represents approximately 92% of the US market. The Russell 1000速 Index is constructed to provide a comprehensive and unbiased barometer for the large-cap segment and is completely reconstituted annually to ensure new and growing equities are included.
