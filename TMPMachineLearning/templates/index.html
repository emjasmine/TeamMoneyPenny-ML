                They say when you come across a penny on the ground showing heads up it's a lucky penny, and you should
                pick it up; however, if it's tails up, it's unlucky, and you should just leave it on the ground. We're
                here to turn that unlucky penny over to bring the luck to you and grow your wealth.
              </p>
              <p>
                To continue our mission of helping you grow your wealth, we have developed a new tool, the Recommender. 
              </p>
              <p class="summary-text2" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 50px;">
                The Recommender tool looks at stocks from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and leverages stock information, including five years of history, from Yahoo Finance and Machine Learning models to find groups or clusters of stocks that are similar. If you have a stock in your portfolio that you love, this tool could help you indentify stocks that could potentially perform similarly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Go to our Recommender tool and start exploring!
